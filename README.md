## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Today's challenge was building the Typemaster pre-launch landing page. It requires a good understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 (responsive design)

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Svelte**

## Development

This was the 2nd project that I've built using Svelte. Even though it's only the 2nd time I'm working with Svelte, I've already started to get reeled in by this compiler.

Since this was a larger project than the [previous one](https://github.com/Remus432/order-summary-component), I was able to use more of Svelte' potential when it comes to building quick and reactive pages. 

The interesting part was breaking down the landing page in smaller components. Because of Svelte, I was able to have the structure, styling and logic all in one self-contained environment. This made for an enjoyable coding experience and it definitely eased my workflow.

The biggest challenge was, as always, trying to get as close as possible to the original design. There were plenty of issues along the way when it came to making the landing page responsive.

I also played around with GSAP some more to get a feel for what it can do in a larger context.

Obviously, you don't have to use Svelte for this project - HTML and CSS suffice.

But if you want to experience a different kind of workflow and open yourself to a new way of building your projects, I highly recommend giving Svelte a shot.
